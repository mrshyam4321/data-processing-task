# Data Processing and API Development Approach

This repository demonstrates solutions to a data processing challenge and API development task using Python and Django REST Framework. Below is the detailed explanation of the approach taken for both tasks.

---

## Task 1: Data Processing & Analysis

### **Objective**
- Clean, preprocess, and analyze a dataset to uncover insights and optimize data handling.

### **Approach**
1. **Loading the Dataset**:
   - Used `pandas` library to efficiently load the dataset in CSV format.
   - Validated the file path and ensured proper handling of missing or malformed files.

2. **Exploration**:
   - Applied methods like `head()`, `info()`, and `describe()` to understand dataset structure and summary statistics.
   - Checked for missing values using `isnull().sum()`.

3. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - Counted and analyzed missing values to decide whether to drop or impute them.
   - Applied imputation using statistical techniques such as mean, median, or mode for numerical and categorical columns.

4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Transformed numerical features using scaling techniques (e.g., `StandardScaler`).
   - Encoded categorical features via one-hot encoding to ensure compatibility in modeling.

5. **Optimization**:
   - Reduced memory usage by converting data types (`astype`).
   - Leveraged vectorized operations in `pandas` for faster processing.

6. **Analysis and Visualization**:
   - Conducted correlation analysis and generated visualizations using libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
   - Highlighted trends and patterns to support informed decisions.

### **Outcome**
The cleaned and processed dataset was optimized for efficient handling and ready for further analysis or modeling.

## Task 2: Basic Load API Development

### **Objective**
- Create a REST API endpoint to load and validate a dataset, providing meaningful responses to users.

### **Approach**
1. **API Design**:
   - Utilized Django REST Framework to build the API endpoint (`basic_load_task1`).
   - Integrated error handling mechanisms to manage missing files, empty datasets, and malformed data.

2. **Dataset Validation**:
   - Checked if the dataset was empty or had missing values using `pandas`.
   - Returned metadata such as the number of rows, column names, and a preview of the data in JSON format.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Used `try-except` blocks to handle exceptions such as:
     - File not found (`FileNotFoundError`).
     - Empty data file (`pd.errors.EmptyDataError`).
     - CSV parsing errors (`pd.errors.ParserError`).
   - Provided user-friendly error messages in the API response.

4. **Response Design**:
   - Incorporated structured responses:
     - Dataset preview (first 10 rows).
     - Metadata (total rows and column names).
     - Missing value information if applicable.

5. **Modularity**:
   - Kept the function modular and reusable for future enhancements or additional features.

### **Outcome**
The API endpoint successfully loads and validates datasets, detects missing values, and provides a comprehensive response tailored to user needs.
